# iotdrawer
-Securing your personal drawer at your home or workplace and keeping your belongings like passport, money, important files paperwork, etc. safe is one of the jobs you have to deal with in your day to day life. Traditional drawers need keys for unlocking them which can be misplaced or misused anytime. Anybody can easily tamper it by just having the same pair of keys used for your drawer which could lead to the loss of your belongings.

At the same time, the current pandemic situation has made us skeptical about every physical contact that we make in public places. Public Places such as government hospitals, offices, police stations, etc have lots of old drawers that can only be accessed by directly using a key to open it. Now imagine that a single piece of key goes through how many places in order to achieve its end goal which is simply “locking or unlocking them”.
